This is my final Project for UIUC CS498 Data Visualization Course.

As the purpose of the work is to learn D3.js and for peer review, vanilla ES 5 is used without any packaging tool. Each
chart is placed in its own file.

Only a week of data are used from the original dataset. They are also proprocessed by a Python script so that they can
be fit into a browser envrionment.
